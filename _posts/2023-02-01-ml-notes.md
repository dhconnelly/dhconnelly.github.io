I've decided to properly learn Machine Learning: the math, fundamentals,
workflow - not just applying some framework. I took a course in grad school but
forgot most of it, and then I worked on a system for Google Maps that predicated
hundreds of categorical attributes for tens of millions of POIs, but without
really understanding the details and math behind the model. But this is Very Big
now (er, again? again again, etc), so I'd like to really dig into it.

I'll link notes and Colabs below as I go along.

## Machine Learning Crash Course

**Course**: [https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course)

**Status**: Done

**Review**:

This ~15 hour video-heavy course provides a broad overview of the field. The
emphasis is on linear and logistic regression, neural networks, and
applied/engineering factors. There are also some "programming exercises" that
provide ~zero learning value, as you do little more than just read and execute
existing TensorFlow code.

## Introduction to Statistical Learning

**Book** (2nd edition): [https://www.statlearning.com/](https://www.statlearning.com/)

**Status**: Stopped after chapter 2. Seems really great - the discussion is
clear and rigorous, but it skips over too much of the math. I have a degree in
applied math and would like to see more of those details!

**Colabs, notes, and exercises**:

-   Chapter 2: Statistical Learning: [notes](/isl/isl-ch2.pdf), [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ZO0Ua-Tr1azrRGgMAzkOQX3GTEeAM-Kw?usp=sharing)

## Mathematics for Machine Learning

**Book**: [https://mml-book.github.io/](https://mml-book.github.io/)

**Status**: Finished reading ch. 2, working through exercises

**Exercises**:

-   Chapter 2: Linear Algebra (TBD)
