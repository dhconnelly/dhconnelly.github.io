I've given in and decided to learn Machine Learning. I took a course in grad
school and then promptly forgot everything, and I worked on a system for Google
Maps that predicated hundreds of categorical attributes for tens of millions of
POIs, but without understanding the ML pieces in any meaningful detail. Well,
the job market is different now, and time makes fools of us all.

I'll link notes and Colabs below as I go along.
