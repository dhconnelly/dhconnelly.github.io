I've decided to spend some time digging into Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
I took an ML course in grad school but forgot most of it, and I worked on a
system for Google Maps that predicated hundreds of categorical labels for tens
of millions of POIs, but without really understanding the details and math
behind the model. Since this is Very Big now (er, again? again again, etc) it
seems a good time to take it seriously as something I should understand.

I'll link notes and Colabs below as I go along.

## Machine Learning Crash Course

**Course**: [https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course)

**Status**: Done

**Review**:

This ~15 hour video-heavy course provides a broad overview of the field. The
emphasis is on linear and logistic regression, neural networks, and
applied/engineering factors. There are also some "programming exercises" that
provide ~zero learning value, as you do little more than just read and execute
existing TensorFlow code.
