I've given in and decided to learn Machine Learning. I took a course in grad
school and then promptly forgot everything, and I worked on a system for Google
Maps that predicated hundreds of categorical attributes for tens of millions of
POIs, but without understanding the ML pieces in any meaningful detail. Well,
the job market is different now, and time makes fools of us all.

A rough outline of my plan is as follows:

-   Phase 0: Overview. Work through Google's [Machine Learning Crash Course](#machine-learning-crash-course).
-   Phase 1: Foundations. Work through [Mathematics for Machine Learning](#mathematics-for-machine-learning) and [Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](#introduction-to-statistical-learning) (but translate the R to Python).
-   Phase 2: Applications and Tools. Work through [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow](#hands-on-machine-learning).
-   Phase 3: Engineering and Real Data. Read [Designing Machine Learning Systems](#designing-machine-learning-systems) and work through [some](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic) [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) [competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic).

I'll link notes and Colabs below as I go along.
