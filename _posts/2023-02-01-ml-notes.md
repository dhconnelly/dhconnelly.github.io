I've given in and decided to learn ML. I took a course in grad school and then
promptly forgot everything, and I worked on a system for Google Maps that
predicated categorical attributes for 60 million+ POIs, but I've never really
intended to learn the material in any real detail.

I'll link notes and Colab notebooks below as I go along.
