# Notes: Machine Learning

I've given in and decided to learn ML. I took a course in grad school and then
promptly forgot all of the material, and I worked on a system for Google Maps
that predicated categorical attributes for 60 million+ POIs, but I've never
really intended to learn it in detail.

I'll link notes and Colab notebooks below as I work through the material.
