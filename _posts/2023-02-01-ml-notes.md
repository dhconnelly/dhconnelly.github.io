I've given in and decided to learn Machine Learning. I took a course in grad
school and then promptly forgot everything, and I worked on a system for Google
Maps that predicated hundreds of categorical attributes for tens of millions of
POIs, but without understanding the ML pieces in any meaningful detail. Well,
the job market is different now, and time makes fools of us all.

I'll link notes and Colabs below as I go along.

## Machine Learning Crash Course

**Course**: [https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course)

**Status**: Done

**Review**:

This ~15 hour video-heavy course provides a broad overview of the field. The
emphasis is on linear and logistic regression, neural networks, and
applied/engineering factors. There are also some "programming exercises" that
provide ~zero learning value, as you do little more than just read and execute
existing TensorFlow code.
